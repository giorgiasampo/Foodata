# FOOData project

### Introduction

FOOData was created for the Open Access and Digital Ethics exam by Vanessa Bonanno, Giorgia SampÃ², and Sarah Tew.FOOData explores food production, pollution, and health markers within Europe both individually and together to get a clearer picture of their interlation. FOOData uses geospatial visualizations to reconnect users with the geographic reality of food production and pollution. 

### Scenario

This project aims to show connections between food production, pollution and health conditions in European countries from 2009 to 2019, focusing in particular on different countries' production of food, their health, and pollution status.

We hypothesize that areas with more agricultural pollution will have worse health outcomes and that different types of pollution and food production affect health differently.

To do so we collected data from EUROSTAT, the European Environmental Agency and FAOSTAT.

### General analysis (excel file ?)

### Quality analysis of datasets (copy from our doc or put a link)

### Legal analysis (same)

### Ethical analysis (same)


### Technical analysis (here: format, metadata, URI etc, we can link or copy/paste)

### Mashup and output datasets  
FAIR data management -> In general terms, your research data should be 'FAIR', that is findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable
Explain why our data are:
- findable
- accessible
- interoperable
- re-usable


### Sostenibility of the update the datasets over the time

FOOData is based on datasets from different sources, about food production, pollution and life expectancy in European Countries. This website has been created as the final project of the Open Access and Digital Ethics course of the Master Degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge at the University of Bologna: the dataset is not actively maintained, while the datasets used for this project are currently maintained by the relative institutions or organisations.
