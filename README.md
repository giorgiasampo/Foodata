# FOOData project

### Introduction

FOOData was created for the Open Access and Digital Ethics exam by Vanessa Bonanno, Giorgia SampÃ², and Sarah Tew.FOOData explores food production, pollution, and health markers within Europe both individually and together to get a clearer picture of their interlation. FOOData uses geospatial visualizations to reconnect users with the geographic reality of food production and pollution. 

### Scenario

This project aims to show connections between food production, pollution and health conditions in European countries from 2009 to 2019, focusing in particular on different countries' production of food, their health, and pollution status.

We hypothesize that areas with more agricultural pollution will have worse health outcomes and that different types of pollution and food production affect health differently.

To do so we collected data from EUROSTAT, the European Environmental Agency and FAOSTAT.

#### **Crops and livestock production**

The production section is based on data found at FAOSTAT, the Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database maintained by the statistics division of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

FAOSTAT presents a huge dataset on food and agriculture with data from over 245 countries and territories with a time span which goes from 1961 to 2020. Data are divided into 13 diverse domains, such as trade, prices, population and employment, but also forestry, land, climate change and food production. In turn, food production is divided in three main categories: Crops and livestock products, Production indices, Value of agricultural production. 

#### **Pollution and environmental damage**

This datasets is devoted to pollution issues and environmental damages in European countries and was obtained from the mesh-up of 5 datasets coming from Eurostat and one form the European environmental Agency. 

The dataset published by Eurostat were also collected from other sources such as JRC, FADN and EEA itself.
Another important aspect of these datasets was the fact that they did not adopt all the same NUTS classification for geographical locations nor they had the same chronological organization. 

#### **Life expectancy**

FOOData uses life-expectancy to indicate overall population health. This data comes from Eurostat: Life expectancy by age, sex and NUTS 2 region. The original dataset contained life expectancies by age, sex, NUTS 2, NUTS 1, and NUTS 0 regions from 1990 to 2019. The FOOData edited dataset limits the Eurostat data to life expectancy at birth from 2010-2019 in current EU member countries.


### General analysis (excel file ?)

### Quality analysis of datasets (copy from our doc or put a link)

### Legal analysis (same)

### Ethical analysis (same)


### Technical analysis (here: format, metadata, URI etc, we can link or copy/paste)

### Mashup and output datasets  
FAIR data management -> In general terms, your research data should be 'FAIR', that is findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable
Explain why our data are:
- findable
- accessible
- interoperable
- re-usable


### Sostenibility of the update the datasets over the time

FOOData is based on datasets from different sources, about food production, pollution and life expectancy in European Countries. This website has been created as the final project of the Open Access and Digital Ethics course of the Master Degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge at the University of Bologna: the dataset is not actively maintained, while the datasets used for this project are currently maintained by the relative institutions or organisations.
